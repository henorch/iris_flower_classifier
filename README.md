Business Objective

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the species of a flower among three categories using the Iris Flower Dataset.
The model takes flower measurements as input and predicts the corresponding species.

This project demonstrates a classification workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

📊 Dataset

The project uses the popular Iris Flower Dataset sourced from Kaggle.
It contains 150 samples across three flower species:

Iris Setosa

Iris Versicolor

Iris Virginica

Each sample consists of four numerical features.

🧠 Model Used

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) was used for this study.

Why KNN?

The dataset does not exhibit strong linear relationships

KNN performs well for small, well-structured datasets

It is effective for multi-class classification

No assumptions are made about data distribution

🧾 Input Features

To make a prediction, the user must provide the following features:

Sepal Length (cm)

Sepal Width (cm)

Petal Length (cm)

Petal Width (cm)

These features are used by the trained model to predict the flower species.

📈 Model Evaluation

The model performance was evaluated using:

Train-test split

Accuracy score

Confusion matrix (optional if included in your notebook)

(Add actual metrics if available)

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn (if used)
